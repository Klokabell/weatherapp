# Weather-App README

## About:

This is the front-end task for the Etteplan assignment during the Junior Software Engineer hiring process. It’s a weather display application for 4 cities Etteplan has offices in. It displays the weather currently in whichever option is chosen and the forecast for the next 15 hours. The ability to display all 4 cities on screen is also an option, with the layout being designed for mobile (Figure 1.) but being responsive enough for desktop (Figure 2.)
